### Course Description

This course will study theoretical aspects of prediction and decision-making probelms, and to explore the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning. We hope to bring students to the frontiers of research and to develop tools that can be used to contribute to emerging literature. The course will cover, among other things, concentration inequalities, uniform deviation bounds, Vapnik-Chervonenkis Theory, Rademacher Complexity, margin bounds, boosting, some theoretical aspects of deep learning, online learning theory, regret minimization, multi-armed bandit algorithms, and connections to convex optimization. Additional topics may be covered if time permits, including reinforcement learning theory, differential privacy, sampling, and and other areas of interest. 

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with the analysis of algorithms, probabilistic analysis, and several similar topics. CS7641 (Machine Learning) may be helpful but not strictly necessary. The material will be about 90% "theory" and thus students must have a strong mathematical background. We shall rely heavily on techniques from calculus, probability, and convex analysis, but many tools will be reviewed in lecture.

**Coursework:** There will be 4 problem sets throughout the semester.

**Grade Breakdown:**
* 40% - *Homeworks*
* 30% - *Exam*
* 20% - *Final project*
* 10% - *Scribing/participation*

**Note**: The exam will be held on Thursday March 30 during classtime.

### References:

Roughly half of the course will follow material from the following text:

 * "[Foundations of Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Machine-Learning-Adaptive-Computation/dp/026201825X)" by Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh, and Ameet Talwalkar

Much of the material in online learning is specific to this course. For students that want more in-depth reading material on this topic, however, there are several surveys released in the last several years that explore several many areas we shall cover. These include:

* [The Multiplicative Weights Update Method](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/pubs/MWsurvey.pdf) by Sanjeev Arora, Elad Hazan, and Satyen Kale.
