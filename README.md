### Course Description

This course will study theoretical aspects of prediction and decision-making probelms, and to explore the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning. We hope to bring students to the frontiers of research and to develop tools that can be used to contribute to emerging literature. The course will cover, among other things, concentration inequalities, uniform deviation bounds, Vapnik-Chervonenkis Theory, Rademacher Complexity,  boosting, some theoretical aspects of deep learning, online learning theory, regret minimization, multi-armed bandit algorithms, and connections to convex optimization. Additional topics may be covered if time permits, including reinforcement learning theory, federated learning, etc.

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with the analysis of algorithms, probabilistic analysis, and several similar topics. CS7641 (Machine Learning) may be helpful but not strictly necessary. The material will be about 90% "theory" and thus students must have a strong mathematical background. We shall rely heavily on techniques from calculus, probability, and convex analysis, but many tools will be reviewed in lecture.

**Coursework:** Most lectures will have homework problems! They will be clearly stated in class, and written into the lecture notes. We will *strongly encourage* students to complete the week-by-week, so as to help follow along with the lecture material. But they will only be officially due *three days before the exam*, and we will release solutions a day later (two days before exame).

**Grade Breakdown:**
* 60% *Exams*
* 30% *Homeworks*
* 10% *Scribing/participation*

### Lecture notes

Every lecture will have two student scribes, and this pair of students will be asked to take detailed notes in class on what was covered. The quality of these notes will be graded! 

**Grade Rubric:**
* 20% - *punctuality*
* 40% - *correctness*
* 40% - *readability*

[Here is the course wiki](https://github.com/mltheory/CS7545/wiki).

Note: all students are allowed and encouraged to contribute to this wiki! Once the scribes have submitted their notes, other students are welcome to add any additional comments, results, material, etc. to the lecture notes. It would be great if the wiki provides a broad set of resources for students, beyond what was covered in lecture.

Much of the material in online learning is specific to this course. For students that want more in-depth reading material on this topic, however, there are several surveys released in the last several years that explore several many areas we shall cover. These include:
